# Soldier-Invasion
This project was created using a tutorial from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.
Changes from the original include all new artwork, and different game mechanics to make the game more playable.
The game is still a work in progress, but can be played from start to finish.
To run the code you will need to install pygame: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
